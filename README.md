## An Ionic notes App integrated with Firebase

## Steps to use this project:
#### Fork/clone the repo & run npm install to install node modules inside project folder
#### To run in the browser, type `ionic serve` & it will start on localhost
#### To run for android/ios, provide path to SDK & set home variables, 
#### after that run `ionic cordova run android` & it will launch as a native app. Similarly, for ios

#### Firebase provides backend services like Authentication, Database, File Storage and others.
